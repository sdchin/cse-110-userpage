# Welcome to Steven's user page! ｡･:\*:･ﾟ★,｡･:\*:･ﾟ☆
## So glad you could make it. Let me introduce myself:

### *Who am I?*
My name is Steven Chin. I'm a fourth-year student studying math and computer science at UCSD (c/o 2023). My main interest lies in front-end development, and I'm also interested in UI/graphic design and accessibility. In my free time, I enjoy listening to K-pop ([click for my favorite song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7mPqycQ0tQ)) and playing TFT. My favorite programming language is ~~HTML~~ all of them because I love all of them equally ~~except I love HTML more~~. Here's my favorite thing I've coded:
```
    /\_____/\
   /  o   o  \
  ( ==  ^  == )
   )         (
  (           )
